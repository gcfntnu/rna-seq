"""
UniVec is a non-redundant database of sequences commonly attached to
cDNA or genomic DNA during the cloning process.  It was developed by
staff at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, part of
the National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of
Health. UniVec_Core is a subset of the full UniVec database.

UniVec primarily consists of the unique segments from a large number
of vectors but also includes many linker, adapter and primer
sequences. Redundant sub-sequences have been eliminated from the
database to make searches more efficient and to simplify
interpretation of the results.

A detailed description of UniVec is available on the web:
  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/VecScreen/UniVec.html

UniVec_Core
-----------
UniVec_Core is designed for use in applications where the hits will be
automatically processed without any human review. The sequences in
UniVec_Core are a subset of those from the full UniVec database chosen
to minimize the number of false positive hits.

UniVec_Core includes only oligonucleotides and vectors consisting of
bacterial, phage, viral, yeast or synthetic sequences. Vectors that
include sequences of mammalian origin are excluded. Consequently, some
vector contamination that could be detected using the full UniVec
database may be missed when UniVec_Core is used.
